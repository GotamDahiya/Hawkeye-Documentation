# Attack Helicopter SOP

This is one area where rules are stringent and will not be relaxed or bent during an operation. CAS pilots will need to be alert throughout the op and if required cycled through.

## Liaising with Pronto

Before takeoff, the pilot should liaison with Pronto over a pre-defined frequency, either 65 or 87, and state that the pilot is transitioning to the AO. The loadout should be shared with Pronto so that they know where the helicopter can be used.

### Engaging Targets

CAS pilots will only _**engage targets when specified by Pronto and Sunray**_. The only time when CAS pilots can engage without authorisation is for self-defence if hiding does not work.&#x20;

It is possible that a HVT is hiding near the AA which the CAS bird is targeting for self-defence, before engaging tell Pronto so that they are informed. If told to disengage, disnegage immediately and run for the safest area and recuperate.

There will be no free-fire zones placed during the mission, troop movements will hinder it, friendly-fire incidents will increase and Zeus will actively try to destory you.

Excessive range shooting will not be tolerated. Maximum targeting range if 1.5km from friendly forces with prior authorisation.

## Loiter

When in the AO, it is recommended to keep a loiter pattern, marked in purple. This defines where you will be flying and from where to start your attack runs. Keep in mind that the loiter pattern takes mamximum advantage of the terrain. The helicopter will be actively pinged by AA and MANPADs.&#x20;



Loiter Points should be defined with the following pattern, <mark style="color:purple;">LP xxx</mark>, with <mark style="color:purple;">x</mark> ranging from 0-9 both inclusive, the first <mark style="color:purple;">x</mark> will have 1-9. The first number denotes which CAS bird has the loiter points and the second and third numbers denotes the number of the loiter point. For example, the first CAS bird will have LP 101, LP 102 and so on, while the second CAS bird will have LP 201, LP 202 and so on.

### Battle Points

These are used for denoting attack runs and will be placed down by _**Pronto**_ only. They follow the same numbering convention as the loiter points. The only difference is that they are marked in red with the following name, <mark style="color:red;">BP xxx</mark>.

### Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance areas will be provided by Pronto and Sunray. Loiter points should be established by the crew and a loiter should be maintained. There will be no engagement by the CAS bird as it is possible that there is a HVT or mission specific assets present in the region.

While maintaining a CAS loiter, only call out target(s) when they are 1km-750m away from friendly forces along with the direction from which they are approaching the callsign(s). If the target(s) are withing 750m, there is a 50% chance that they have not seen it. Anything greater than 1.5km-2km away from a friendly force is mostly Zeus placed assets, and if are not present in a recoinnassance specified-area should only be taken note off and passed when appropiate.&#x20;

## Multi-Crewing

If the helicopter requires a co-pilot/gunner, then laser designator, all laser guided munitions, and rotating weapons will be assigned to the co-pilot/gunner. The dumb-fire weapons, wire-guided weapons and anti-air weapons will be assigned to the pilot.&#x20;

The weapons sign-off can be configured using the _<mark style="background-color:green;">Configure Pylons</mark>_ ACE interaction on the helicopter. The pilot will need a toolkit and the _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">Rearm & Repair</mark>_ box near the helicopter. It is slightly buggy so advised to empty all pylons first and when putting on the new pylons set the weapons controller.&#x20;

Before take-off check if the weapons are assigned correctly or not.

## Sections

Section and Team leads are to have laser designators and red smoke ready when requesting for CAS. Hawkeye averages 100knots(200km/h) when flying CAS. Pilots cannot see a BTR in a grid square when flying that fast without exposing themselves dangerously to enemy fire.

A good practice to mark on map where you want the munitions to land, it gives the pilots a good reference for where they are supposed to go. Naming convention will be _countries names_ in red. For example, <mark style="color:red;">MP MEXICO</mark>.

Laser designators codes are used for marking targets for laser guided munitions, for example hellfires. Ground forces laser designators will be set to <mark style="color:blue;">Channel B,1112,</mark> while helicopter's laser designators will be set to <mark style="color:blue;">Channel A,1111</mark>. DAGRs cannot accurately lase onto a ground laser due to code issues so they will be fired using the helicopter's laser designator.&#x20;

The red smoke helps the in looking for the target both visually and via the camera. Red smoke denotes enemy forces and a green smoke denotes friendly forces unless specifed and verified by section leads and CAS pilots. The red smoke is used for missile and gun runs, and for launching DAGRs.



Hellfires are to be **only used on heavily armoured vehicles or aerial targets**, not medium to light skinned. DAGRS and other munitions types can easily take care of the rest. The only time a hellfire will be used on medium armoured vehicles and below is if the CAS bird has run out of other missile types and it is emparitive that the vehicle be destroyed.

Missile and gun runs are dumb fire rockets, and cannons and miniguns rounds from the helicopter. Specify from which direction they are to ingress and egress. These are general area effect weapons and should be used very delicately, as proved from priot experiences of firendly fire incidents.
