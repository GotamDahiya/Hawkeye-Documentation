# Attack Helicopter SOP

## Liaising with Pronto

Before takeoff, the pilot should liaison with Pronto over a pre-defined frequency, either 65 or 87, and state that the pilot is transitioning to the AO. The loadout should be shared with Pronto so that they know where the helicopter can be used.

## Loiter

When in the AO, it is recommended to keep a loiter pattern, marked in purple. This defines where you will be flying and from where to start your attack runs. Keep in mind that the loiter pattern takes mamximum advantage of the terrain. The helicopter will be actively pinged by AA and MANPADs.&#x20;



Loiter Points should be defined with the following pattern, <mark style="color:purple;">LP xxx</mark>, with <mark style="color:purple;">x</mark> ranging from 0-9 both inclusive, the first <mark style="color:purple;">x</mark> will have 1-9. The first number denotes which CAS bird has the loiter points and the second and third numbers denotes the number of the loiter point. For example, the first CAS bird will have LP 101, LP 102 and so on, while the second CAS bird will have LP 201, LP 202 and so on.

### Battle Points

These are used for denoting attack runs and will be placed down by _**Pronto**_ only. They follow the same numbering convention as the loiter points. The only difference is that they are marked in red with the following name, <mark style="color:red;">BP xxx</mark>.

## Multi-Crewing

If the helicopter requires a co-pilot/gunner, then laser designator, all laser guided munitions, and rotating weapons will be assigned to the co-pilot/gunner. The dumb-fire weapons and anti-air weapons will be assigned to the pilot.&#x20;

The weapons sign-off can be configured using the _<mark style="background-color:green;">Configure Pylons</mark>_ ACE interaction on the helicopter. The pilot will need a toolkit and the _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">Rearm & Repair</mark>_ box near the helicopter. It is slightly buggy so advised to empty all pylons first and when putting on the new pylons set the weapons controller.&#x20;

Before take-off check if the weapons are assigned correctly or not.
