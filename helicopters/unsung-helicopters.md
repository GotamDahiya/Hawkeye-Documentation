# Unsung Helicopters

This provides a detailed documentation for the Hueys, Chinooks, OH-6As and Sea Stallions of the Vietnam Era.

None of the choppers have Vehicle in Vehicle cargo space. Only ACE cargo space can be used, so expect a slightly longer time to load and unload cargo.



The CH-47A Chinook and CH-53A Sea Stallion behave just like the RHS Chinook and Sea Stallion, so proceed [here](transport-helicopters.md#ch-47f-chinook). The Chinook has a non-functioning digital MFD, while in the Sea Stallion the only thing I trust is the attitude indicator.

## Bell UH-1 Iroquois

The most common and used helicopter in the Vietnam War and ushered in the age of helicopter borne combat operations.

The UH-1 was the first turbine-equipped US helicopter to go into production. The initial models till UH-1M were powered by one turbine engine with UH-1N being the first Iroquois to be powered by two separate turbine engines.&#x20;

&#x20;The Iroquois were given the name Huey from the sound of the two helicopter blades spinning in the air.

Compared to the UH-60M blackhawk and the MH-6M Littlebird, the Huey has analogue steam gauges present in the console. They are not overly accurate in the mod as speed is displayed in km/h, the vertical speed indicator is kind of slow and the attitude indicator does not have a centre line so at best the pilot is guessing the helicopter is level with the horizon.

The visibility from the cockpit is extremely limited due to massive console and large frame of the cockpit door. It is advised while landing to sit as high as possible and to land at a slight offset from the approach path. For a more accurate model of the cockpit refer to SOG:PF CDLC UH-1. the pilots can see much better out from there.

During operations ranging from dusk to dawn, formation and anti-collision lights should be turned on, to provide situational awarness to other helicopters and ground troops. Searchlights should only be turned on during a difficult approach or when deemed necessary by the pilot.

### Engine

The engines on the Huey till UH-1M were notoriously underpowered for the tropical climate in Vietnam. In AFM, this is simulated with the helicoter struggling to gain altitude without translational lift. In SFM the helicopter flies perfectly fine without any restrictions.

### Armaments

Their are two M60s as door guns in the cabin of the helicopter. The have searchlights attached to them which can only be switched on by the pilot or co-pilot by turning all lights.

The crew stations, pilot, co-pilot, crew chief, and door gunner, can throw smoke grenades, fragmentation grenades and signal flares via the scroll wheel menu. These are unlimited but will only be deployed when given orders by the pilot.

### Variants

There are two primary variants present in the Unsung mod,

1. Slick : These models are used for transport of troops and cargo.&#x20;
2. CAS : There are multiple types of Hueys which provide CAS with different armaments. Limited to no seats for carrying infantry.

## OH-6A Cayuse

The OH-6A Cayuse is the precursor to the famous MH-6M Littlebirds and it's various variants. It was nicknamed _Loach_ after it's acronym of LOH or Light Observation Helicopter. The OH-6A was used predominatly as a scout for ground troops and as a hunter in conjuction with the AH-1H Cobra.

During operations ranging from dusk to dawn, formation and anti-collision lights should be turned on, to provide situational awarness to other helicopters and ground troops. Searchlights should only be turned on during a difficult approach or when deemed necessary by the pilot.

It has an oval glass cockpit providing excellent visibility for the pilot and co-pilot. The conole containing the steam gauge dials is present in the centre of the cockpit to the front. This is shared between both the pilot and co-pilot.

### Engine

The Cayuse is powered by a single T63-A-5A turboshaft engine. This engine drove a 4 blade main rotor giving the best rate of climb, speed and endurance for that era. Only issue is that the engine is more designed for providing power to a reconnaisance helicopter and not a transport or CAS.

### Armaments

The pilot and co-pilot have the capability to dropp signal flares, smoke grenades and fragmentation grenades. The OH-6A can also be fitted with a side mounted machine gun but this sacrifices seating for ground troops. The side gun has a searchlight mounted on it, but it can only be turned on by either the pilot or co-pilot.

A third variant of the OH-6A can be fitted with rocket pods and a minigun on pylons with a door mounted gun. This variant is not as nimble as the other two due to the extra weight of the pylon armaments.
