# F/A-18C,D

The only difference between the F/A-18C and F/A-18D is the co-pilot/Weapons System Officer(WSO)

## Usage

The Hornet handles like the F/A-181 Black Wasp present in the Jets DLC. To switch on the Engine, HUD, I-TGT and Afterburner, scroll menu is used. Keybinds can also be set for the custom add actions et by Firewill for the F/A-18.

The Weapons System Officer has access to the weapons as assigned while loading them.

The F/A-18 A and B versions do not have access to the Inertial Targeting System, I-TGT, which is used to guide GPS guided bombs to their target.

### Pylons

There are a total of 9 pylons present on the F/A-18 C/D. The pylons are numbered 1 to 9 from the pilot's left.

The two outer most pylons, _<mark style="color:blue;">1 and 9</mark>_, can only carry short range IR guided missiles along with smoke producer pods.

The center pylon should be used as a fuel tank as maximum amount of fuel is used in takeoff. It can also carry smoke producer pods.

The two inner most pylons on the wing, _<mark style="color:blue;">4 and 6</mark>_, can only take radar guided AMRAAMS and targeting pods. It is recommended that there be one targeting pod on either pylon so that laser guided munitions can be guided to their target.

The other 4 pylons, _<mark style="color:blue;">2, 3, 7 and 8</mark>_, can carry any weapons system except the targeting pods

### Missiles

#### Air to Air missiles

1. AIM 9 series IR guided Sidewinders.
2. AIM-120 series Radar guided missiles.
3. AIM 7 series Radar guided missiles.
4. AIM-132 IR guided missiles.
5. IRIS-T IR guided missiles.

#### Air to Ground Missiles&#x20;

Most AGMs are laser guided with a small cone of detection, so make sure that the nose of the airplane is pointing towards the laser marked contact.

1. AGM 65 series Maverick missiles.
   1. 65D Maverick -> IR Guided
   2. 65H Maverick -> EO/CG
   3. 65F -> IR Guided
   4. 65G -> IR
   5. 65K -> EO/CG
   6. 65E -> LG
   7. 65E2 -> LG
   8. 65L -> LG
2. AGM 88 HARM, anti-radiation missile, used to take out any active radar emitting vehcile. The plane's radar does not have to be on, just the vehicles.
3. AGM 84D Harpoon, active Radar guided missile, used primarily against ships but can also be used against ground targets.
4. AGM 132 Skipper II, laser guided missile, similar to the Maverick
5. AGM 84E/H/K SLAM-ER, GPS/IR guided cruise missile.
6. AGM 158B JASSM-ER, GPS/IR guided cruise missile.

#### Hydra Rockets and Variants.

1. Hydra M229/M151 HE and M247 HEAT rockets. Depending upon the following configuration the number of rockets change,
   1. LAU-131 -> 7 rockets per pod
   2. LAU-61/A -> 19 rockets per pod
   3. LAU-68FA -> 14 rockets per 2 pods

{% hint style="info" %}
The APKWS rockets are _Laser Guided Hydras_. Smaller cone of detection than the Mavericks. A box will appear on the HUD and the laser marked contact will have to be in that box.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not use the Zunis, they tent to fall short of the target and you need to be really close to get any kills. DO NOT USE THEM.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The targeting reticule for the Hydras is dependent upon which pylon they are on. So aim accordingly.
{% endhint %}

2\. Poniard LAU-13 are 7 IR guided munitions.

### Bombs

This section is divided based upon the weight of the explosives present in the bomb. Bigger the weight bigger the boom, except for the Scalpel which is a low collateral bomb with a big boom.
